 CHARLEMAGNE_NAME:1 "Charlemagne"
 CHARLEMAGNE_DESC:1 "The Early Middle Ages started with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the early 5th century. The earlier part of this era saw the great Germanic and Slavic migrations across Europe, with peoples such as the Goths and Lombards settling in Southern Europe, the Franks settling in Gaul and Saxons crossing the sea and settling in Britain. The Eastern Roman Empire was violently shaken by the pressure from the Goths and Avars, and fought bitterly with the ancient Persian enemy. The rise of Islam saw the Arabs conquering immense amounts of territory in the Middle East and North Africa, and in India several great dynasties vied for dominance, with the Rashtrakutas rising towards the end of the 8th century. In the steppes, the Khazars grew in power, and in Scandinavia things were about to change in a way that was to affect the entire continent."
 OLDGODS_NAME:1 "The Old Gods"
 OLDGODS_DESC:1 "How the little piglets would grunt if they knew how the old boar suffered.'§! Those were the prophetic last words of the legendary viking §YRagnarr Loðbrok§! as he lay dying in the snake pit of Northumbrian king §YÆlla§!. In 867 the vengeful sons of Loðbrok and their 'Great Heathen Army' descended upon the petty kingdoms of Britain to make of §YÆlla§! a 'Blood Eagle'. Meanwhile, two other Norse lords - §YRurik§! and §YDyre§! - were carving out their own rival states among the Slavic and Finnish tribes of the East, laying down the foundations for what would one day become Russia. The Old Gods are still strong and their warriors mighty!"
